What was the "big problem" that led to the development of information architecture in the 1990s? Be specific.
 
  The massive rise of the internet! Happened quickly and extensively. Websites became crazy masses of unorganised, 
  inaccesible information because they weren't planned properly.

What was the effect of adding search to websites? How does this differ from the way you may have looked at websites 
before starting this course?

  Meant that more websites are organised in a way that is much more accessible and allows for multiple 'front doors' 
  with less emphasis placed on the single homepage.
  
What does it mean to say that an information architect is a "bridge builder"? What kinds of bridges do information 
architects build?

IA's build bridges between users and information, information and information, and locations and information.
  
What is the IA mindset?

It is an empathy mindset, which helps us empathise and understand what the user wants. 'Architects of Understanding'

What is PACE layering?

It's around systems thinking. Using visual languages to explain an categorize multiple things happening all at once. 
To do with big picture thinking and small scale thinking all at once.
