I didn't use any place holders in my form, but to avoid unconscious slips things I'd do:
-Format the phone number as the user types
-ask user to re-enter email address
-Have auto-complete on the postal address section
-format D.O.B as user types i.e. DD/MM/YYYY
-I'd ensure that the T&C button can't be clicked until user has clicked terms and conditions
(which I would have linked)
