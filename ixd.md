-IxD is specifically focused on the interactions between user and technology. UX is broader, focusing on the whole 
experience.

-Focuses on goals on end-user, is not really concerned with the technological capabilites. 

-Affordance is something that is designed to look like what it actually does. Bad affordance would be a button that doesnt look like a button, a trash 'folder' or even a link that isn't underlined. 

-In the real world, bad examples might be: Alcohol free wine / what looks like a pen but is actually a pencil  


Under what circumstance should interaction designers take great effort in making that interface learnable? 
What kinds of knowledge and skills do they need to do this?

I think in all circumstances we should be ensuring that our interfaces are learnable. This means that it will be 
accessable to more people, no matter what their level of tech literacy is.

I think having some understanding of cognitive psychology would be useful for ensuring your interfaces are learnable.
