What is the difference between IxD and UX?

IxD is specifically focused on the interactions between user and technology. UX is broader, focusing on the whole 
experience.

What is goal-driven design? (GDD) Check the resources below for an excellent presentation on GDD if you have time.

Focuses on goals on end-user, is not really concerned with the technological capabilites. 


What does it mean to say that "the best interaction designs donâ€™t exist"?




Remind us again, what's an "affordance"? And what do you think a "bad affordance" might be? Can you think of 
any examples in the physical world?

Something that is designed to look like what it actually does. Bad affordance would be a button that doesnt look
like a button, a trash 'folder' or even a link that isn't underlined. 

In the real world, bad examples might be: Alcohol free wine / what looks like a pen but is actually a pencil  


Under what circumstance should interaction designers take great effort in making that interface learnable? 
What kinds of knowledge and skills do they need to do this?



What do you think one of the hardest parts of being an interaction designer is? Do you think this applies to 
full-stack web developers as well?
