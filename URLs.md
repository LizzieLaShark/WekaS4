The difference is that absolute URL's include the domain name in them whereas relative URL's do not. It is easier and faster to code relative URL's and if you have a staging environment, relative URL's allow you to have content on both the 'real' and 'staged' versions of your site.

Absolute URL's are best because:
-It makes it a lot easier for Google to crawl your site, which = better indexing & increased search engine optimisation.
-It makes it harder for scrapers to steal your site
-Page duplication. It's not hideously bad but not great either. 

When the author talks about four different sites, she's meaning the same website on four slightly different domain names. Essentially the same website duplicated three times.

Crawl budget is the energy search engines puts into crawling your website. This is important because if your site is not easily 'crawlable' then search engines wont index your site as thoroughly. If your site isnt indexed thoroughly then it wont rank as highly when people search for key terms related to your site.
